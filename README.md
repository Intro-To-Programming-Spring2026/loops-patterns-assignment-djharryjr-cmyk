# Weekly Assignment — Loop Patterns

## Overview
In this assignment, you will use **for loops** and **numbers** to create a pattern.

Your goal is to show how loops repeat actions and how numbers control repetition.

---

## Your Task

Your program must:
1. Ask the user for a number
2. Use a for loop to repeat output
3. Create a visible pattern
4. Print clear output

---

## Pattern Ideas
You may create patterns using:
- Symbols (stars, dashes, etc.)
- Numbers
- Repeated words

Examples:
- A line of stars
- Counting patterns
- Repeated shapes

---

## Requirements
- Use at least **1 for loop**
- Use **range()**
- Output must repeat in a clear pattern
- Program must run (or almost run)

---

## Rules
- This must be your own work
- NO AI tools allowed
- Ask for help if you’re stuck
